Q: what is conll2000?
Ans	Text Chunking architecture

Q:What is num_unit in tf.nn.lstm?
Ans 	num_unit = size of horizantal array of interconnected LSTM cells. 
	aka. num_unit = dimension of hidden state (h[0]? or h[1]?)

	>note:	cell_unit in tf and lstm paper represent differnt things
		>in tf, cell_unit = dimension of hidden state
		>in lstm paper, cell_unit = unit of gates eg. forget gate, update gate etc.
		>in lstm paper, cell_state = memory of lstm

Q: What does control_dependency do?
Ans: 	a context manager that specifies control dependencies for all operations constructed within the context

Q: What is DBpedia?
link: https://wiki.dbpedia.org/about
Ans: 	database that is a crowd-sourced community effort to extract structured contect fom the information created in various wikimedia projects.
	>note: wikimedia is a non-profit company who built wikipeia and other projects including dbpedia

Q: What is Concept Identification?
link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept
Ans: 	Concept Identification is abstract represtation of a word within its context.
	>note: In the other word, it is a node (a class) in an ontology of knowledge base vocabulary.

Q: What is embedding_lookup in TF?
link: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34870614/what-does-tf-nn-embedding-lookup-function-do
Ans:	Embedding_lookup could regroup elemet of multiple tensors of the same shape.
		>note: it is more convenient to manage multiple large tensor with in this way.
Q: What is Boundary detection?
Ans: 	Boundary detection is to distinguish one word/sentence from other words/sentences in a given documents.
	
Q:What is Genia?
Ans: Genia is a Sentence Splitter which is optimised for biomedical texts.

Q:What is UMLS?
Ans: The purpose of UMLS is to facilitate the development of computer systems that behave as if they "undestand' the meaning of the languagae of biomedicine.
	>The UMLS knowledge sources are multi-purpose and are used in systmes that perform divers fuctions involving information types 
		>>eg patient records, scientific literature guidelines, and public health data.

Ans:

Q: What is the use of glob package in python?
Ans:	glob package is used to find pathnames using regular expression.
		>note: it returns list of found pathnames.
