=====TODO LIST
============================
> I need label for hospital, re-admission. #STUCK HERE
    : no data set for problem, re-admission, and hospital
    >> Can I train it separately???
> make lstm compatible
    : FILE = model.py
    : FILE = entity_lstm.py CLASS = EntityLSTM
    >> figure what are structure of dataset that is exceptable for EntityLSTM
    >> look into EntityLSTM code and figure out what it does in detail.

> learn how to search and download data from pubCrawler #STUCK HERE

goal is to run data given from Prof.Zhu on Cliner with high accuracy prediction
>Fine tuning CRF
    >> lets try out algorithms option from pycrfsuite
        >class 1 and 6 tends to be misclassified
            :'B-problem':1
            :'I-treatment':6
        > algorithm:{‘lbfgs’, ‘l2sgd’, ‘ap’, ‘pa’, ‘arow’}
            > arow is the worst
            > lbfgs performs the same as l2sgd
            > ap and pa equally the best
                   :pa tends to hvae higher recall.

    >> Analyze whether or not the output is exceptble.
        :CRF overfitt to training dataset (suspect I have too little dataset)

    >> I need more insight of the prediction to investigate #STUCK HERE
        :why does it not perform well?
        > calculate over micro/macro averaging
        > show probability of prediction
        > show entities that are misclassified.

    >> Do I need to change features??

==============================
=== MAIN PROBLEM
==============================


==============================
=== RESULT USING DR.ZHU DATASET + PUBMED
==============================
USING CRF
> note1
    : cannot detect anythin
> note2
    : misclassify a type of protein as problem (what is criteria for problem?)
    : cannot detect serveral problems
    (no teatment and test present)
> paper1
    :Only classify problems (due to unbalanced in training set?)
>paper2
    : misclassify alot of things
        >>such as misclassify "sciencegoogle scholar" as problem
    : predict not only problems, but also treatment. (not test was predicted)
